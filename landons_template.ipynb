With close to 120 million monthly active users and 40 million daily users worldwide, the game has become one of the most dominant games in the MOBA world. Well be working with a dataset developed by Oracle’s Elixir, which contains match data from professional League of Legends esports games played in 2022. It’s filled with detailed statistics from real esports games, giving us insight into how players perform, how teams operate, and what affects the outcome of matches.\n",

In professional League of Legends, the ban phase involves both teams selecting champions to be removed from the game's pool, preventing them from being picked by either side. This phase alternates between each team banning a champion, with each team having a total of 10 bans. Teams use the ban phase to prevent the enemy team from picking strong or counter-picking champions. \n",
